[Tracxn reports show that more than 90,000 new startups have been launched each year since 2020.](https://platform.tracxn.com/a/s/query/t/companiescovered/t/all/table?h=1201a11b5055777da86a527bea641c268ca70ba7fbaeb2875cfb6b75bcce9bb2&s=sort%3Drelevance%7Corder%3DDEFAULT) Notably, AI startups are leading the pack. The struggle to differentiate oneself has never been more intense. In 2024, nearly 13% of all newly established companies are AI startups, highlighting the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence in the startup landscape. 

As numerous startups vie for recognition, strong branding becomes crucial for making your business distinctive and memorable to customers. Your brand provides a unique identity that communicates your values and narrative, helping customers recognize you amid the crowded startup market.

Startups can fail for various reasons, but a significant factor is the absence of effective marketing strategies. [Zippia reports that 22% of startups fail due to marketing-related problems.](https://www.zippia.com/advice/startup-statistics/#:~:text=34%25-,Marketing%20problems,22%25,-Team%20problems) Although branding and marketing are distinct, branding undeniably plays a crucial role in supporting all marketing efforts.

## Why Should You Take Branding Seriously?

1. **Credibility**:
The brand of your startup can influence your customers more than you might think. Branding encompasses more than just the logo and color scheme. A strong brand should naturally create a sense of community and loyalty without needing to solicit it. In addition to its visual appeal and credibility, branding can act as a crucial support during tough times. A notable instance of this was during the Covid-19 pandemic when many companies depended on their branding strategies to navigate the market challenges.

2. **Higher Revenue**:
Over 70% of B2C consumers choose to buy from brands they recognize on social media, while 52% of B2B buyers make purchases only after reviewing the content. Maintaining consistency can boost your revenue by 10-20%.

3. **Team Quality**:
Have you ever dreamed of joining your favorite brand before launching your startup? Today, candidates consider more than just the job position or salary when applying to a company. Enhanced branding can also help decrease employee turnover by 28%.

4. **Enhanced Marketing**:
Hashtags and tags can significantly boost your presence on social media. G2 reports that 64% of consumers like to tag brands in their posts, while 45% will stop following a brand if they feel it engages in excessive self-promotion. When your brand is shared through word-of-mouth, or perhaps I should say tags-of-keypad, it gains natural visibility, which can lower your expenses on paid marketing.


## How To Create Brand Guidelines?
Fortunately, similar to other stages in a product's life cycle, AIs can be beneficial here too. While we aren't at the point where AI can create something completely independently, with your assistance, you can automate certain branding tasks and enhance efficiency. Many organizations currently utilize chatbots for customer support, and over 80% of marketers incorporate AI in various ways. However, it's important to remember that the key to a brand's success is in its ability to personalize experiences.
