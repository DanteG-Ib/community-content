The excitement at the **lablab NEXT** Stockholm office was undeniable as we prepped for our very first **Demo Day**. The usual buzz transformed into focused anticipation as everyone geared up for the big event.

When the time came, our **Program Team** proudly kicked things off, and the startups took the stage to showcase how much they had grown over the past six weeks. It was truly a pitch-perfect evening!

But before we get into Demo Day, letâ€™s take a quick look back at how Cohort 1 came together and led to this unforgettable moment.

## Prep Week
Before the cohort officially began, we kicked things off with introductory sessions for both mentors and startups. The focus was on creating a supportive, collaborative space. We reassured everyone that this program was built around learning and growing together.

## Week 1: Connecting and Pitching
We started with a **welcome call**, where mentors and startups met to exchange insights and discuss needs. Startups delivered their **first pitches**, giving us a preview of the innovative ideas to come. The week was packed with knowledge-sharing sessions on **technical leadership**, **innovation**, and industry trends, wrapping up with an expert-led AI session. This week was crucial to understand each startup's specific needs and align them with mentors who could provide targeted guidance, and plan the upcoming weeks.

## Week 2: Sharpening Focus
With the pace picking up, we dove into more complex topics like **MVP launches**, **technical leadership**, and **KPI setting**. Startups reassessed their missions and prepared for upcoming challenges. Separate sessions with CEOs, CTOs, and mentors ensured deep discussions on growth strategies.

## Week 3: Gearing Up for Demo Day
As Demo Day approached, we held an **internal pitch practice**, and the energy was high. We explored **AI tools** to help startups automate tasks and boost efficiency. Startups fine-tuned their **value propositions** and business models, while mentors provided guidance on crafting impactful messaging.

## Week 4: Refining the Sales Pipeline
We focused on the **sales pipeline**, helping startups shape strong selling strategies. With mentors' customized feedback, startups pitched againâ€”this time with more confidence and clarity. The collective wisdom of our mentors played a crucial role in this growth.

## Weeks 5 & 6: The Final Push
The final stretch was intense! ðŸš€ Startups refined their **GTM strategies**, **customer acquisition**, and **branding skills**, with mentors offering support in fundraising and strategic planning. A standout session on **AI product adoption** highlighted how to build user trust. By the end, our startups were **Demo Day ready**!
