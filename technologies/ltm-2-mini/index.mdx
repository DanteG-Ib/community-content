# LTM-2-mini
**LTM-2-mini** (Long-Term Memory Mini Model) is a cutting-edge AI model developed by Magic, designed to process extremely large contexts efficiently. Capable of handling up to 100 million tokens (equivalent to 10 million lines of code), this model is revolutionizing industries that require the analysis of vast datasets. Its innovative sequence-dimension algorithm allows for efficient processing, making it approximately 1,000 times more resource-efficient than traditional attention-based models like Llama 3.1. The LTM-2-mini significantly enhances machine comprehension over longer contexts, enabling better reasoning and recall in tasks like software development, legal document analysis, and database management.
